# Welcome!

My name is Tobi Schweiger, and I am a 21 year old CS student at [SIUE](https://www.siue.edu).

# About me
I moved to the United States from Munich, Germany to St. Louis, MO about 9 years ago.
Since I was young, I always wanted to create something. So I learned how to program at the age of 10, starting with [BlitzBasic2D](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blitz_BASIC), moving up to VB.NET, and at some point, teaching myself PHP.

Since then, I have dabbled in almost any framework or language you can think of - I have made games using Unity, written server administration software in C# and .NET using [NancyFX](http://nancyfx.org/), game and app templates using Swift, [a static site generator using Dart](https://github.com/tobischw/boris), taught a ML to figure out when my dog sits, and much, much more.

# Projects
* [Pronghorn](https://github.com/objectcomputing/Pronghorn) - Pragmatic approach to a staged event driven single machine embedded micro-framework. Responsible for testing and documentation.
* [Notery](https://devpost.com/software/notery) - Collaborative note taking for students. Winner of 2019 eHacks "Best UI/UX". Responsible for frontend.
* [Boris](https://github.com/tobischw/boris) - Unfinished. Dead simple static generator, written in Dart.
* [dart-lox](https://github.com/tobischw/dart-lox) - Unfinished. Toy-language Lox interpreter, written in Dart.

# Experience
During my sophomore year at SIUE, I landed an internship at [Object Computing Inc.](https://objectcomputing.com/), one of the most reputable software contractors in the area. I was responsible for writing iOS apps for a new MQTT framework (called [GreenLightning](https://oci-pronghorn.gitbook.io/greenlightning/), check it out!), developing a React-based dashboard for monitoring said MQTT framework, and testing as well as cobbling together documentation for a unique and _blazing fast_ actor-framework called [Pronghorn](https://opensource.com/article/18/6/writing-applications-java-pronghorn), written in Java.
